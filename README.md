Production Performance Dashboard â€“ Power BI Automation

![Dashboard Screenshot](Dashboard.png)

ðŸ“Š Overview

This project showcases a fully automated Power BI dashboard built for tracking weekly production KPIs in a manufacturing machine shop. The dashboard consumes job and runtime data from the MES (Manufacturing Execution System), significantly reducing manual effort and human error in KPI reporting.

Designed to assist shift engineers and managers, this solution enables fast, data-driven decisions by visualizing key metrics like OEE, Availability, Performance, Rework %, and Schedule Adherence.

Problem Statement

Previously, weekly KPI reports were generated manually using Excel. This was:

- Time-consuming (1â€“2 hours per week)
- Prone to inconsistencies and manual errors
- Delayed visibility into operational issues

---

Solution

By structuring Excel files to align with MES exports, and connecting them to Power BI with calculated metrics and benchmarks, this solution automates report generation. Now, pasting data into the Excel template updates the full dashboard instantlyâ€”no manual calculations needed.
